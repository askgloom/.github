</div>

A modern C++ framework for building intelligent agents with human-inspired memory systems and cognitive architectures.

## About

Gloom is a sophisticated toolkit designed for researchers and developers working on artificial intelligence systems that require human-like memory capabilities. It provides a robust foundation for building agents that can form, retain, and recall memories in ways that mirror human cognitive processes.

## Core Features

### Memory Systems
- **Episodic Memory**: Store and retrieve temporal sequences of experiences
- **Semantic Memory**: Represent and query conceptual knowledge
- **Memory Management**: Smart retention and pruning based on importance

### Agent Architecture
- Modular design for flexible agent construction
- Built-in planning and decision-making systems
- Environment abstraction layer for versatile deployment

### Technical Highlights
- Thread-safe operations
- Modern C++ design (C++17)
- High-performance implementations
- Comprehensive memory management
- Flexible query systems

## Design Philosophy

Gloom is built on three core principles:

1. **Cognitive Plausibility**: Memory systems inspired by human cognition
2. **Performance**: Optimized for real-world applications
3. **Flexibility**: Modular design for custom implementations
